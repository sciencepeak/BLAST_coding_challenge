The pipelines for different sequencing platforms use blast extensively to query sequences against a given database. One of the steps, in an earlier version of a pipeline, heavily relied on blasting to eliminate primer and adaptor sequences from the reads to generate clean and manageable datasets. You are provided with fasta and quality files from a dataset that was generated using 454 sequencing platform. You are required to blast the dataset against the given primer and adaptor sequences and generate output in m8 format. 

You need to write a small program using python that will take: 

a) Fasta and quality files containing the reads and corresponding quality scores.
b) Adaptor and primer sequences are:
Primer Sequence:CGCCGTTTCCCAGTAGGTCTC
Adaptor Sequence:ACTGAGTGGGAGGCAAGGCACACAGGGGATAGG

The program should generate the following output:

1) Total number of reads in the original dataset
2) Total number of reads greater than 100 bp in the original dataset
3) Total number of reads with average quality scores greater than 20 in the original dataset
4) Total number of reads with primer sequences
5) Total number of reads with adaptor sequences
6) Total number of reads with both primer and adaptor sequences

In addition, your program needs to generate the following files:

1) Blast output file in the table format.
2) Fasta file containing reads greater than 100bp, average read quality scores greater than 20, primers and adaptors trimmed.
3) Tab de-limited text file containing the read identifiers along with the starting and end positions of the primer and/or adaptor sequences.
